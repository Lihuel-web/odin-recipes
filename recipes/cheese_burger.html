        <h2>Description</h2>
    Lasagna is a type of Italian dish made by layering flat pasta sheets with meat or vegetables, cheese, and a sauce, typically a meat- or tomato-based sauce.
    The dish is then baked in the oven until the sauce is hot and bubbly and the pasta is cooked through.<br>
    The result is a hearty and flavorful meal that is often served with a side salad or garlic bread.
